## Description

A lofi playlist generator that creates a Spotify playlist for you depending on the length of your study session.

To make the most of this application, turn off autoplay in the settings of your Spotify account. By doing so, your music will stop playing once the end of the playlist has been reached, signifying the end of your study session :)
